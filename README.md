#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have the snake game running to the point where the snake is moving on the screen with pygame.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We need to get the snake images and add the "food" and the power ups

None really. Including the power ups was our "hope to accomplish" and I think we are on track to do that!
